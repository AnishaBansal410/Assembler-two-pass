ERRORS HANDLED:-
 
 1.) STP FOUND IN FIRST LINE

 2.) START FOUND MORE THAN ONCE
 
 3.) NUMBER OF OPERANDS REQUIRED CORRESPONDING TO A PARTICULAR OPCODE DOES NOT MATCH

 4.)  NO OPCODE FOUND

 5.) START NOT FOUND ERROR

 6.) INSTRUCTION LENGTH IS 0

 7.) INSTRUCTION LENGTH>256

8.) WRONG FORMAT ERROR (FOR EX:- L1: X)

ASSUMPTIONS:-
 
*We have not used registers. 

*Literals are specified using '=x' format'.

*"DC" is used as a declarative statement.

*Maximum instruction length is 3.

*In the final output, there will be a 8 bit code representing the instruction number in binary representation form, and thereafter, there will be 8 bit addresses  corressponding to the label or     variable present and 4 bit opcode present.

* "START" statement is compulsory for the program.
